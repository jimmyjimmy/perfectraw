What is perfectRAW?

= Details =

*perfectRAW* is a new technical multiplatform photo RAW developer based in our modified version of the nice and free (GNU licensed) dcraw code by David Coffin, also in the foundation of most RAW developers out there.

The idea comes from _GUI_ and Manuel Llorens, users of OjoDigital forums, who wanted to add some GUI facility to their improved dcraw version (supports 32bits pure gamma and resolves the labyrinth problems found in many cameras, but specially in four-thirds ones -mainly Olympus and Panasonic- when advanced demosaicing algorithms are used for interpolation, PPG, AHD...). You can also download this dcraw version as source code and win32 executables from this site.

With perfectRAW where are providing a different concept of RAW developer. It is not intended for every photographer/every day use/every photograph, but for those moments when you want to extract as much information as posible from every pixel. So, its interface is different from many other RAW developers, as it is based in a per pixel basin.

perfectRAW is being developed in a portable mix of C/C++/C# and will compile with a combination of gcc and Mono project.
